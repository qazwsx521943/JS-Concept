            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
            const team2 = players.slice();

            person1.name = "Jason Chung";
